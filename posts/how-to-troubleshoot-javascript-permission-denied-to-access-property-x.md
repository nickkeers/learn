When you are working in JavaScript, you may come across an error similar to the following.

```js
Error: Permission denied to access property "x"
```

Or, you may see it in a slightly more verbose form:

```js
Uncaught DOMException: Permission denied to access property "document" on cross-origin object
```

This error usually occurs when you try to access an object for which you have no permission, the most common
case is when you try to access a property of an `<iframe>` loaded from another domain for which you violated
the [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

## Reproducing the error

An example which causes the above error is this example document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example code</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <iframe src="http://example.com"></iframe>
    <script>
      window.onload = function() {
        console.log(window.frames[0].document);
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Solution

The recommended way to solve this error is to only try and access properties of an iframe which points to a domain that you control, this will ensure that your code obeys the same-origin policy.

If you want to communicate with the iframe, you can use `window.postMessage` â€” however, the embedded website must have an
event listener to handle the `message` event and that must be written in a way to allow communication cross-origin.

An [example is here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage#example) from Mozilla Developer Network.
